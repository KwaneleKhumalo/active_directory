# Active Directory Home Lab 
(Still under development)

## Introduction

Active Directory (AD) is a Microsoft service developed to centralize the management or an organization's network resources across defined domains. It stores data as objects, making it intuitive for administrators and users to find and use. 

This lab will demonstrate the process of setting up the lab environment using Virtual Box, installation of Microsoft's Windows Server and Windows 10. We will then demonstrate how to setup a domain network, install AD, Join the AD and much more.
